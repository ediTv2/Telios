A quick and robust linux healthcheck script to automate various hardware tests.

# Status
NOT stable for production use.


# Goals
The goal of this project is to simplify and automate the tests network technicians 
are asked to run to find any faults on the targeted system. Whether that be
drive faults, SMART analysis, memory faults, or abnormal temperature ratings.
Telios aims to run all these tests for you and provide you with easy to read feedback, 
and you help you isolate issues faster than having you run all these tests individually.
